Our development effort is a very personal process compared
to "traditional" ways of developing software. Your code and ideas
behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in critique and
criticism. The review will almost always require improvements to the
code before it can be included. Know that this happens because everyone 
involved wants to see the best possible solution for the overall success 
of this project.

As a reviewer of code, please strive to keep things civil and focused on
the technical issues involved. We are all humans, and frustrations can
be high on both sides of the process. Try to keep in mind the immortal
words of Bill and Ted, "Be excellent to each other."
