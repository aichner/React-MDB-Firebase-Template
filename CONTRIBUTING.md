## [](#commits)Commits

- All commits must be verified. [Learn how to sign commits using GitKraken](https://support.gitkraken.com/git-workflows-and-extensions/commit-signing-with-gpg/).
- All commit summaries must start with an uppercase letter.
- All commit summaries must be written in present tense.
- The commit summary and description are mandatory.
- All commit descriptions must be written in past tense.
- The commit headline must have a maximum of `71 chars`.
- The commit message must have a maximum of `71 chars per line`.
- If possible, include link to online topic as reference `Ref: `.
- The purpose of the commit and your intentions behind it must be clear.
- Include references to issues if applicable.
- No commit, under no circumstances, should be pushed to master directly.
- Each commit should only serve one distinct purpose.

## [](#pull-requests)Pull Requests

- Each pull request should only follow one general topic.
- You must follow the template for creating a pull request.
- Each pull request must have at least one assigned developer.
- Each pull request must have a label. If issues are present, it has to include those at a minimum.
- Each pull request should be merged by a reviewer.
- Each pull request has to pass all checks and reviews before merging.
- Each pull request should include linked issues. Although it is not mandatory, it helps to track the thoughts of the developers and is therefore strongly advised.

## [](#coding-style)Coding Style
We generally follow the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/rule) ES6 rules.
This code of conduct will outline some of the most important rules and showcase some of the use-cases.

It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code with all recommended Extensions when working on code
with the agency or under the agency’s supervision. Use the built-in code quality
improvement tool `Prettier` as often as possible. It does not only help you to keep
focus and be more efficient, it also improves the code quality tremendously

The following rules are one of the most important.
- Try to keep the maximum line length below `80`. The maximum line length is `120`.

**Bad**
```
let foo = { "bar": "This is a bar.", "baz": { "qux": "This is a qux" }, "difficult": "to read" };
```
**Good**
```
let foo = {
 "bar": "This is a bar.",
 "baz": { "qux": "This is a qux" },
 "easier": "to read",
};
```

- Comments have to follow the following standards:

```
/**
 * This is a multiline comment
 */

/**
 * This is a multiline comment.
 * It has multiple sentences.
 */

//> This is a header and can introduce following, related comments

// This is a single line comment

// This is a single line comment. It has multiple sentences.
```

- Use regions if you have more than 3 distinct areas in your file.
- (Such as imports, classes, type-declarations, exports, …). This helps to organize the file.

```
//#region > Classes
/**
 * @class Foo
 * @description A basic description of the functionality
 * of the class.
 */
class Foo {
  constructor()
}
//#endregion
```

- Try to keep the line count in one single file below 400.
- After declaring variables, add a new line.

```
const a = 1;
const b = 2;

return a + b === 3 ? true : false;
```

- The indentation must be 2 spaces.
- Use `const` and `let` where ever possible. Do not use `var` if not required.

## [](#versioning)Versioning

- Each merge of a branch to master should have a suitable change in the version if applicable.
- Each change in version has to be documented with the creation of a new release, including a changelog.
- Always use semantic versioning. (Major, Minor, Patch) See <https://semver.org/> for more information.
