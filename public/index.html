      We suggest using https://www.favicon-generator.org/ to generate your custom favicon.
      Create a new folder in public named "fav" and copy all extracted files of favicon-generator.org to it.
      Include the files using the provided code snippet by favicon-generator.org - do not forget to adjust the paths 
      using the %PUBLIC_URL% as base.
    -->
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">
    <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
